Just as Pixel Perfect for Firefox can save you from clients and designers wanting perfect layouts, PixelFuck allows you to pander to the worst of your coworkers bs by allowing you to overlay comps and wireframes over webpages while you build them.

Is that margin supposed to be off-center or was it the designers fault?

Now you'll know who to blame. Thanks PixelFuck!
